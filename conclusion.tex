\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclude}
This paper has introduced the GFIC, a proposal to choose moment conditions and parameter restrictions based on the quality of the estimates they provide. 
In simulations for two panel examples, the GFIC performs well, as does our proposed averaging estimator that combines the random and fixed effects specifications.
While we focus here on applications to panel data, the GFIC can be applied to any GMM problem in which a minimal set of correctly specified moment conditions identifies an unrestricted model. 
A natural extension of this work would be to consider risk functions other than MSE, by analogy to \cite{ClaeskensCroux2006} and \cite{ClaeskensHjort2008}.
Another possibility would be to derive a version of the GFIC for GEL estimators. 
Although first-order equivalent to GMM, GEL estimators often exhibit superior finite-sample properties and may thus improve the quality of the selection criterion \citep{NeweySmith}.
