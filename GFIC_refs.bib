	the redundant parameters as zero in the large samples and provides
	the standard GMM limit distribution for the estimates of the nonzero
	
	parameters in the model. The asymptotic theory for our estimator is
	nonstandard. We conduct a simulation study that shows that the Lasso-type

  abstract = {Summary. In biostatistical practice, it is common to use information
	criteria as a guide for model selection. We propose new versions
	of the focused information criterion (FIC) for variable selection
	in logistic regression. The FIC gives, depending on the quantity
	to be estimated, possibly different sets of selected variables. The
	standard version of the FIC measures the mean squared error of the
	estimator of the quantity of interest in the selected model. In this
	article, we propose more general versions of the FIC, allowing other
	risk measures such as the one based on $L_p$ error. When prediction
	of an event is important, as is often the case in medical applications,
	we construct an FIC using the error rate as a natural risk measure.
	The advantages of using an information criterion which depends on
	both the quantity of interest and the selected risk measure are illustrated
	by means of a simulation study and application to a study on diabetic
	
	retinopathy.},

	an information criterion. We propose an extension of the focused
	information criterion (FIC) for model-order selection, with emphasis
	on a high predictive accuracy (i.e. the mean squared forecast error
	is low). We obtain theoretical results and illustrate by means of
	a simulation study and some real data examples that the FIC is a
	valid alternative to the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and the

	possible inclusion or exclusion. We develop a focused information

	subset of covariates. Thus the FIC might find that the best model
	for predicting median survival time is different than the best model
	for estimating survival probabilities, and the best overall model
	for analyzing menís survival might not be the same as the best overall
	model for analyzing womenís survival. Methodology is also developed
	for model averaging, wherein the final estimate of a quantity is
	a weighted average of estimates computed for a range of submodels.
	Our methods are illustrated in simulations and for a survival study

  abstract = {This article is concerned with variable selection methods for the
	Cox proportional hazards regression model. Including excessive covariates
	causes extra variability and inflated confidence intervals for regression
	parameters; thus regimes for discarding the less informative ones
	are needed. Our framework has p covariates designated as “protected,”
	while variables from a further set of q covariates are examined for
	possible inclusion or exclusion. We develop a focused information
	criterion (FIC) that for given interest parameter finds the best
	subset of covariates. Thus the FIC might find that the best model
	for predicting median survival time is different than the best model
	for estimating survival probabilities, and the best overall model
	for analyzing men’s survival might not be the same as the best overall
	model for analyzing women’s survival. Methodology is also developed
	for model averaging, wherein the final estimate of a quantity is
	a weighted average of estimates computed for a range of submodels.
	Our methods are illustrated in simulations and for a survival study
	of Danish skin cancer patients.},

  abstract = {The difference and system generalized method of moments (GMM) estimators
	are growing in popularity.As implemented in popular software, the
	estimators easily generate instruments that are numerous and, in
	system GMM, potentially suspect. A large instrument collection over
	fits endogenous variables even as it weakens the Hansen test of the
	instruments’ joint validity. This paper reviews the evidence on the
	effects of instrument proliferation, and describes and simulates
	simple ways to control it. It illustrates the dangers by replicating
	Forbes [American Economic Review (2000) Vol. 90, pp. 869–887] on
	income inequality and Levine et al. [Journal of Monetary Economics]
	(2000) Vol. 46, pp. 31–77] on financial sector development. Results
	in
	
	both papers appear driven by previously undetected endogeneity.},

	partial linear models (GAPLMs). Polynomial spline is used to approximate
	nonparametric functions. The corresponding estimators of the linear
	parameters are shown to be asymptotically normal. We then develop
	a focused information criterion (FIC) and a frequentist model average
	(FMA) estimator on the basis of the quasi-likelihood principle and
	examine theoretical properties of the FIC and FMA. The major advantages
	of the proposed procedures over the existing ones are their computational
	expediency and theoretical reliability. Simulation experiments have
	provided evidence of the superiority of the proposed procedures.
	The approach is further applied to a real-world data example.},
