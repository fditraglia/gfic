  Abstract                 = {This paper proposes the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator–type (Lasso-type) generalized method of moments (GMM) estimator. This Lasso-type estimator is formed by the GMM objective function with the addition of a penalty term. The exponent of the penalty term in the regular Lasso estimator is equal to one. However, the exponent of the penalty term in the Lasso-type estimator is less than one in the analysis here. The magnitude of the exponent is reduced to avoid the asymptotic bias. This estimator selects the correct model and estimates it simultaneously. In other words, this method estimates the redundant parameters as zero in the large samples and provides the standard GMM limit distribution for the estimates of the nonzero
parameters in the model. The asymptotic theory for our estimator is nonstandard. We conduct a simulation study that shows that the Lasso-type GMM correctly selects the true model much more often than the Bayesian information Criterion (BIC) and another model selection procedure based on the GMM objective function.},

  Abstract                 = {Hjort & Claeskens (2003) developed an asymptotic theory for model selection, model averaging and subsequent inference using likelihood methods in parametric models, along with associated confidence statements. In this article, we consider a semiparametric version of this problem, wherein the likelihood depends on parameters and an unknown function, and model selection/averaging is to be applied to the parametric parts of the model. We show that all the results of Hjort & Claeskens hold in the semiparametric context, if the Fisher information matrix for parametric models is replaced by the semiparametric information bound for semiparametric mode ls, and if maximum likelihood estimators for parametric models are replaced by semip arametric efficient profile estimators. Our methods of proof employ Le Cam’s contiguity lemmas, leading to transparent results. The results also describe the behaviour of semiparametric model estimators when the parametric component is misspecified, and also have implications for pointwise-consistent model selectors.},

  Abstract                 = {In order to make predictions of future values of a time series, one needs to specify a forecasting model. A popular choice is an autoregressive time-series model, for which the order of the model is chosen by an information criterion. We propose an extension of the focused information criterion (FIC) for model-order selection, with emphasis on a high predictive accuracy (i.e. the mean squared forecast error is low). We obtain theoretical results and illustrate by means of a simulation study and some real data examples that the FIC is a valid alternative to the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) for selection of a prediction model. We also illustrate the possibility of using the FIC for purposes other than forecasting, and explore its use in an extended model.},

  Abstract                 = {Summary. In biostatistical practice, it is common to use information criteria as a guide for model selection. We propose new versions of the focused information criterion (FIC) for variable selection in logistic regression. The FIC gives, depending on the quantity to be estimated, possibly different sets of selected variables. The standard version of the FIC measures the mean squared error of the estimator of the quantity of interest in the selected model. In this article, we propose more general versions of the FIC, allowing other risk measures such as the one based on $L_p$ error. When prediction of an event is important, as is often the case in medical applications, we construct an FIC using the error rate as a natural risk measure. The advantages of using an information criterion which depends on both the quantity of interest and the selected risk measure are illustrated by means of a simulation study and application to a study on diabetic
retinopathy.},

  Abstract                 = {Most model selection mechanisms work in an “overall” modus, providing models without specific concern for how the selected model is going to be used afterward. The focused information criterion(FIC), on the other hand, is geared toward optimum model selection when inference is required for a given estimand. In this paper the FIC method is extended to weighted versions. This allows one to rank and select candidate models for the purpose of handling a range of similar tasks well, as opposed to being forced to focus on each task separately. Applications include selecting regression models that per form well for specified regions of covariate values. We derive these weighted focused information criteria (wFIC) , give asymptotic results, and apply the methods to real data. Formulas for easy implementation are provided for the class of generalized linear models.},

  Abstract                 = {The difference and system generalized method of moments (GMM) estimators are growing in popularity.As implemented in popular software, the estimators easily generate instruments that are numerous and, in system GMM, potentially suspect. A large instrument collection over fits endogenous variables even as it weakens the Hansen test of the instruments’ joint validity. This paper reviews the evidence on the effects of instrument proliferation, and describes and simulates simple ways to control it. It illustrates the dangers by replicating Forbes [American Economic Review (2000) Vol. 90, pp. 869–887] on income inequality and Levine et al. [Journal of Monetary Economics] (2000) Vol. 46, pp. 31–77] on financial sector development. Results in
both papers appear driven by previously undetected endogeneity.},

The corresponding estimators of the linear parameters are shown to be asymptotically normal. We then develop a focused information criterion (FIC) and a frequentist model average (FMA) estimator on the basis of the quasi-likelihood principle and examine theoretical properties of the FIC and FMA. The major advantages of the proposed procedures over the existing ones are their computational expediency and theoretical reliability. Simulation experiments have provided evidence of the superiority of the proposed procedures. The approach is further applied to a real-world data example.},
