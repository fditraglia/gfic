\section{Simulation Results}
\label{sec:simulation}
We now evaluate the performance of the GFIC in a number of simulation experiments based on the Examples form Section \ref{sec:examples}.

\subsection{Fixed vs.\ Random Effects Example}
We employ a simulation design similar to that used by \cite{GuggenbergerRE}, namely
\begin{equation*}
  y_{it} = 0.5 x_{it} + \alpha_i + \varepsilon_{it}
\end{equation*}
where
\[
  \begin{bmatrix}
x_{i1}\\
x_{i2}\\
\vdots\\
x_{iT}\\
\alpha_i
\end{bmatrix}  \overset{\mbox{iid}}{\sim} N \left (
\begin{bmatrix}
0\\
0\\
\vdots\\
0\\
0
\end{bmatrix} , \, 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & \rho & \ldots & \rho & \gamma\\
\rho & 1 & \ldots & \rho & \gamma\\
\vdots & \vdots&  \ddots & \vdots &\vdots\\
\rho & \rho & \ldots & 1 & \gamma\\
\gamma& \gamma &\ldots& \gamma & 1 
\end{bmatrix}
\right)
\]
independently of $\left( \varepsilon_{i1}, \dots, \varepsilon_{iT} \right)' \sim \mbox{ iid } N(0, \sigma_{\varepsilon}^2 \mathbf{I}_T)$.
In this design, $\gamma$ controls the correlation between $x_{it}$ and the individual effects $\alpha_i$, while $\rho$ controls the persistence of $x_{it}$ over time.
Larger values of $\gamma$ correspond to larger violations of the assumption underlying the random effects estimator, increasing its bias.
Larger values of $\rho$, on the other hand, decrease the amount of variation within individuals, thus \emph{increasing} the variance of the fixed effects estimator. 
Figures \ref{fig:REvsFE_T2} and \ref{fig:REvsFE_T5} present the RMSE under this simulation design of the random effects GLS estimator and the fixed effects estimator along with those of the post-GFIC and averaging estimators described above in Section \ref{sec:REvsFE} over a grid of values for $T$, $\gamma$, $\rho$, and sample size $N$.
All calculations are based on 10,000 simulation replications.\footnote{When $T=5$, setting $\rho = 0.3$ violates positive definiteness so we take $\rho=0.4$ as our smallest value in this case.} In the interest of space, we present only results for $\sigma_{\varepsilon}^2 = 2.5$ and our ``coarse'' parameter grid for $\rho$ here. 
Additional simulation results are available upon request.

  \label{fig:REvsFE_T5}
\end{figure}

We see from Figures \ref{fig:REvsFE_T2} and \ref{fig:REvsFE_T5} that, regardless of the configuration of the other parameter values, there is always a range of values for $\gamma$ for which the random effects estimator has a smaller RMSE than the fixed effects estimator.
The width of this range increases as either the number of individuals $N$ or number of time periods $T$ decrease.
It also increases as the persistence $\rho$ of $x_{it}$ increases.
Indeed, when $N$ and $T$ are relatively small and $\rho$ is relatively large, the individual effects $\alpha_{i}$ can be \emph{strongly} correlated with $x_{it}$ and still result in a random effects estimator with a lower RMSE than the fixed effects estimator. 
The post-GFIC estimator essentially ``splits the difference'' between the random and fixed effects estimators.
While it cannot provide a uniform improvement over the fixed effects estimator, the post-GFIC estimator performs well.
When $\gamma$ is not too large it can yield a substantially lower RMSE than the fixed effects estimator.
The gains are particularly substantial when $x_{it}$ is relatively persistent and $T$ relatively small, as is common in micro-panel datasets.
The averaging estimator performs even better, providing a nearly uniform improvement over the post-GFIC estimator.
Only at very large values of $\gamma$ does it yield a higher RMSE, and these are points in the parameter space where the fixed effects, post-GFIC and averaging estimators are for all intents and purposes identical in RMSE.
