In this paper we propose a novel criterion for simultaneous GMM model and moment selection: the generalized focused information criterion (GFIC). 
Rather than attempting to identify the correct specification, the GFIC chooses from a set of potentially mis-specified overidentifying and parameter restrictions to minimize the mean-squared error of a target parameter specified by the user. 
Both the focused moment selection criterion (FMSC) of \cite{DiTraglia2012} and the focused information criterion (FIC) of \cite{ClaeskensHjort2003} and the can be viewed as special cases of the GFIC. 
In addition to the general theory, we specialize the GFIC to a simple dynamic panel model with correlated individual effects. 
In a simulation study based on this example, the GFIC performs well relative to alternatives from the literature.
