In this paper we propose a criterion for simultaneous GMM model and moment selection: the generalized focused information criterion (GFIC). 
Rather than attempting to identify the correct specification, the GFIC chooses from a set of potentially mis-specified moment conditions and parameter restrictions to minimize the mean-squared error of a user-specified target parameter.
In addition to presenting the general theory, we specialize the GFIC to the problem of choosing between random and fixed effects estimators, and propose a novel averaging estimator that combines the two.
In addition, we consider an application to a dynamic panel model, in which the user wishes to select over both the exogeneity assumptions used to generate instruments, and the lag specification.
The GFIC performs well in simulations for both examples.
