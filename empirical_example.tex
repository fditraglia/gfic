\section{Empirical Example: The Demand for Cigarettes}
\label{sec:empirical}
\todo[inline]{Need to write this section! Keep it fairly brief. For now, don't worry about inference. Try to show to cases: one in which the panel is short and we prefer to use the ``wrong'' specification, and another where it is long and we prefer to use the ``right'' specification.}
